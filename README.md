<!-- AI:start:what-it-does -->
This project automates the creation and management of Jenkins jobs for KDE-related packaging workflows. It is used by developers and maintainers to streamline continuous integration and deployment processes for KDE software. The repository includes scripts and configuration files to simplify job generation and customization.
<!-- AI:end:what-it-does -->

## Architecture

<!-- AI:start:architecture -->
The project automates Jenkins job management for KDE packages. It consists of scripts and configuration files to generate, update, and manage Jenkins jobs. The key components include:

- `jjb-builder.py`: Main script for generating Jenkins Job Builder (JJB) configurations.
- `generate.sh`: Script to automate job generation processes.
- `ecm_simple.xml`: Template for Jenkins job definitions.
- `hooks/`: Contains hooks for integration with external systems.
- `jobs/`: Stores job configuration files.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for auxiliary tasks.
- `tools.py`: Helper functions for job generation and management.
- `test.sh`: Script for testing job configurations.

The components interact by using `jjb-builder.py` to process templates (`ecm_simple.xml`) and generate job configurations in the `jobs/` directory. Scripts in `scripts/` and `hooks/` provide additional functionality for integration and automation.

## CI

<!-- AI:start:ci -->
The repository uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The following workflows are defined:

1. **`ci.yml`**: Runs linting and basic tests for the Python scripts in the repository.
   - Triggers: `push` and `pull_request` events.
   - Required secrets: None.

2. **`deploy.yml`**: Handles deployment tasks, including updating Jenkins job configurations.
   - Triggers: Manual dispatch via the GitHub Actions interface.
   - Required secrets: `JENKINS_URL`, `JENKINS_USER`, `JENKINS_API_TOKEN`.

3. **`test-suite.yml`**: Executes the full test suite, including integration tests.
   - Triggers: `push` to the `main` branch and scheduled runs (`cron`).
   - Required secrets: None.

Ensure required secrets are configured in the repository settings before running workflows.
